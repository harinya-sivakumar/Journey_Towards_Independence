            India has a long and glorious history of its struggle for Independence. 
            The times it has been ruled by foreign powers have seen an extraordinary unity amongst the people in India. 
            During this time, people of India have stayed close to each other, no matter what caste, religion, state or race they belonged to.
            Now, India has earned its freedom, which cannot be achieved without making great efforts for it. 
            The Indian freedom movement began in 1857. 
            It was a large scale campaign headed by Indian nationalist leaders who sought to liberate India from British rule.
